For assignment 1, read only one data file.

Make sure you test your program with both data files that are provided. Test one file at a time.

The data file must reside in this data folder.

You can declare that file name as a constant at the top of main.cpp (file that has the routine main(), or you can have it inside main(). Do not put the input and output file names anywhere else.
